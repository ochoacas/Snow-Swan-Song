# Ocean Acidification (OA) Risk Map: Pacific Northwest shellfisheries

### Project Description:

This interactive map was developed to visualize inter-annual hotspots of ocean acidification, four shellfish species' biophysical thresholds at each life stage, and the network of shellfish stakeholders across the Pacific Northwest. The map aims to convey important information to stakeholders about their vulnerability to ocean acidification and to identify potential adaptation pathways.
